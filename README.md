# The 'electrical_load_forecast' package comprises LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models for data-driven forecasting. This involved scraping Electrical Demand data from AEMO's website using Beautiful Soup and collecting weather data from an Australian forecasting website, specifically for Victoria State. The data underwent exploratory analysis via Pandas to discern the influential factors in the forecast. Matrix calculations were conducted using NumPy, and model hyperparameter tuning was accomplished with Keras.

Several LSTM models were assessed by calculating Mean Absolute Percentage Errors (MAPEs), and the most accurate model was chosen based on the lowest MAPE values.
